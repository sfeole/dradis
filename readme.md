# dradis
Dradis Tool,  This is used to interface with multiple Canonical MAAS Servers 
-- Deploy Hosts,
  - Return Host Status and Info
-- List Ipv4 Address Quickly.
Avoid navigating through the UI which can be rather tedious if you maintain 3+ MAAS servers

Features will be added as I need them but for now, the above save minutes off of my day.
